# Analyzing-Students-Mental-Health

Tools Used: PostgreSQL, Power BI

Project Goal: The primary objective of this project is to analyze the mental health of international students in Japan and determine how length of stay impacts depression (PHQ-9), social connectedness (SCS), and acculturative stress (ASISS) scores.

By leveraging SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization, we aim to identify patterns and trends in studentsâ€™ mental health conditions and provide data-driven insights for universities to support student well-being.

**SQL and Power BI Skills Used**

**SQL:** 
- **Filtering** (WHERE) â€“ Select only international students
- **Aggregation** (COUNT(), AVG(), ROUND()) â€“ Calculate the number of students and average mental health scores
- **Grouping** (GROUP BY) â€“ Organize data by length of stay
- **Sorting** (ORDER BY) â€“ Arrange results in descending order of stay length
- **Data Preparation** â€“ Format data for seamless Power BI integration

**SQL Query Used:**

**Power BI Skills:**

- **Data Import & Transformation** â€“ Loading PostgreSQL data into Power BI
- **DAX Measures** â€“ Calculating average mental health scores
- Visualization Techniques:

- ðŸ“Š **Clustered Bar Chart** â†’ Compare mental health metrics across different stay durations
- ðŸ“ˆ **Line Chart** â†’ Show trends in mental health over time
- ðŸŽ› **Slicers & Filters** â†’ Enable interactive analysis by academic level, language proficiency, and stay length

**Project Results & Insights**
- Shorter stays are linked to higher depression, suggesting adaptation challenges.
-  Social connectedness plays a crucial roleâ€”students with stronger support networks have lower depression and stress levels.
-  Longer stays donâ€™t always improve mental healthâ€”some students experience increased stress over time due to academic and cultural pressures.
-  Universities should focus on providing social and psychological support to international students during their early years of study.
